# Breaking changes in v3

This action no longer uses `open-turo/action-setup-tools` as it doesn't need it. If any step that runs
after this action was relying on tools installed by `open-turo/action-setup-tools`, it will need to be
manually added.

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/open-turo/action-setup-tools) for how to use this action.
